# 📊 Predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR) Project
This project was part of a learning challenge on Kaggle, where I explored various modeling techniques to predict the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of ads. Through multiple iterations and experiments, I gained hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model selection, and performance tuning using RMSE.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data_cleaning.R`: Prepares and tidies the dataset
- `random_forest.R`: Trains and tunes a Random Forest model
- `xgboost.R`: Implements XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning

---

## 📌 Goal
The goal is to use ad metadata (visual appeal, targeting score, time of day, etc.) to predict the percentage of people who clicked on the ad.

---

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest & Ranger
- XGBoost with Grid Search
- Evaluation using RMSE

---

## 🔍 Data Description
The dataset includes ad features like:
- Visual appeal (1–10)
- Targeting score (1–10)
- Ad format, position, audience age group
- Sentiment and word count of ad texts
- CTR (target variable)

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Importance of data cleaning & encoding
- How to tune tree-based models using `caret`
- XGBoost gave the best results in terms of RMSE
