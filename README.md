# Predict-CTR-Project
This project was part of a learning challenge on Kaggle, where I explored various modeling techniques to predict the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of ads. Through multiple iterations and experiments, I gained hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model selection, and performance tuning using RMSE.
